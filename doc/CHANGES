    time but less than for a fail-low.
 5) When storing a hash entry that is an eval score, store the hash move
    also, if there is one. Remove an unnecessary test in qsearch.
 6) In Winboard mode, send a response to "ping" immediately when pondering. 
 7) Fix regression in "go searchmoves" command (Github issue #17).

 1) Fix to handling of UCI_LimitStrength and UCI_Elo options. These can now
    be processed in either order and will set the search strength correctly.
 2) Revised tuning program. Only the "Texel" method is supported now. Tuner
    uses a "mean-squared error" objective and takes a labeled EPD file
    as input. Various optimization methods can be selected. Optimization
    steps are scaled appropriately based on parameter ranges.
 3) Changes to king cover and king safety scoring.

    for depth when storing/retrieving from the hash table. Adjust search
    scores based on the tablebase score, when available.

    per the UCI spec. Add some error handling for invalid option names.
 4) Remove threat extension and related code.
 5) Change razoring margins.
 6) Simplify king safety scoring and make most king safety parameters
    tunable.
 7) Tuner now uses the Texel method by default and supports the ADAM
    gradient descent algorithm.
 8) Changes to King cover calculation. Give bonus for King cover only if King
    on rank <=2, and do not rate cover relative to King rank.

Changes in Arasan 19.1:
 1) Change/fix root move reordering. After wide search phase, just move
    the pv move first and other moves down.
 2) Scoring change: limit range of KING_MOBILITY_ENDGAME array.
 3) Add scoring for threats of lower-valued pieces and pawns against
    higher-valued pieces (previously only pawn threats were scored).
 4) Add support for thread affinity via the hwloc library (not enabled
    in the release builds; must recompile from source to get this).
 5) Add restrictions on SEE pruning: don't prune evasions, and only prune
    checking moves if they are not discovered check.
 6) Change extension logic: extend checks if not losing or if discovered.
    Other checks can be pruned (SEE pruning) or reduced. Remove FORCED2
    extension (2 legal evasions).
 7) Pick up en passant fixes from Fathom library.
 8) Add fixes for Android compatibility (although note: Makefiles still do
    not support Android cross-compilation).
 9) Fix bugs in Syzygy probing to avoid non-progress in endgames where
    a repetition has occurred.
 10) Non-POPCNT builds use a better software POPCNT implementation.
 11) Change IID conditions: allow IID in check if in PV. In non-PV node,
     score must not be too bad (like Protector).
 12) In "wide" search mode do not shrink upper bound of search window.
 13) Small changes to LMR reduction formula.
 14) Fixes to terminate multithreaded searches faster when fail-high
 detected.

 7) Fixes to IID. Change IID depth conditions. 
 8) Omit all forms of forward pruning (before the move gen/
    search loop) when any of IID, VERIFY or SINGULAR flags are set.
 9) Allow fractional (half-depth) reductions. Limit reductions so they
    don't hit the q-search. Don't set LMR flag if reduction is 0. Change
    min LMR search depth to 3 ply.
 10) Use only 2 killer moves (not also killers from previous ply as
    formerly).
 11) Do pruning after LMR and using reduced depth (except use non-reduced
    depth for LMP).

 1) Make more parameters tunable, including TRADE_DOWN array. Fix gradient
    computation for Q + minor vs Q material param.
 2) Revise and simplify endgame scoring. Combine endgame score cache
    with king cover cache (since they can use the same hash signature).
    Allow larger values for king endgame scores. Add distance function to
    Scoring. Use local calc instead of array lookup for this function.
 3) Re-tune all parameters using latest rating gauntlet games as training
    file.
 4) Add value fields to effective hash (fixes possible crashes in endgame
    when running multi-threaded).
 5) Add MSVC project files to repository.
 6) For Linux builds with gcc, turn on Link Time Optimization along with PGO.

 13) Increase SEE pruning depth but disable if alpha is a mate score.

Changes in Arasan 18.0 (July 2015):
 1) Add refutation table, similar to Gull & Rodent. This is global and
    refutations are produced in the phase of move generation after killers.
 2) Major restructuring to support automated parameter tuning. Internal
    scores are now in millipawns (1/1000 pawn).
 3) Changes to material balance scoring: in particular, better evaluation
    of some "near draw" situations.
 4) Detect K vs K+B+wrong color pawns as draw with >1 pawn (on same file).
 5) When in UCI analysis mode, output a move even in legal draw situations
    (except stalemate).
 6) Changes to reduced-strength mode. Instead of randomizing eval, now at
    low strength settings the program will select sub-optimal moves
    occasionally.
 7) Changes to time management when search fails low.
 8) Changes to king safety scoring and tuning of related parameters.
 9) Change conditions for static null pruning and razoring. Adjust
    razor margins.

    dependent formula.
 12) Fix GUI bug: changing strength setting during a game was not working.

Changes in Arasan 17.5 (Jan. 2015):
 1) Modify and tune connected passer scoring.
 2) Fixes to book weight computation.

 7) More accurate eval of reduced-material endgames. Fix scoring for
 pawnless Q vs RN.
 8) Changes to time management. Extend time if failing low at end of search,
 but only long enough to resolve the fail-low. In addition, though: extend
 if score is dropping relative to last search - amt of extension now varies
 with how much score has dropped.
 9) Increase king position scores when opponent has very low material.
 10) Some tuning of scoring for blocked passed pawns. A penalty is given now
 if the pawn is blocked but not at the immediate square in front.
 11) Some fixes for Intel C++ (icc) compilation.

Changes in Arasan 17.4 (Oct. 2014):
 1) Deeper LMR (and different reduction formula). After a LMR search
    fails high, first re-search with no reduction but zero width bounds,
    then only do a full-width, full-depth search.
 2) Reduce q-search pruning margin.
 3) Bug fix for pondering in Winboard mode. Engine could fail to ponder
    again after a successful ponder.
 4) Bug fixes to Winboard analysis mode.
 5) Bug fix in Board::wouldAttack.
 6) Widen somewhat the range of conditions that will prevent
    a move from being pruned, based on the null-move threat (if
    there is one).
 7) Simpify & tune late-move pruning code and remove vestiges of history
    pruning.
 8) Add .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES target to Linux Makefile, to make build
    targets work that depend on redefining CC etc.

Changes in Arasan 17.3 (Sept. 2014):
 1) Reduce doubled pawn score in endgame.
 2) Fix some bugs involving hash size settings for UCI.
 3) Minor changes to outpost scores.

    capturing the last piece.
 10) Increase see pruning depth to 1.5 ply.

Changes in Arasan 17.2 (May 2014):
 1) Fix "st" command in Winboard protocol to interpret time as seconds

    piece square tables, new king safety scoring.
 2) Add special-case eval code for K vs K+R and K vs K+Q endgames.
 3) Bug fix: validate hash move in q-search before using it.
 4) Changes to handling of book selectivity option.
 5) Adjust variable strength option so bottom end of strength scale
    is lower (will blunder sometimes).
 6) Increase ply depth in reduced strength mode for very low material
    endgames (engine was having difficulty mating in these cases
    even at moderate strength settings). This also fixes some
    problems with playing into stalemate.
 7) Better handling of out-of-memory errors when allocating hashtable.
 8) GUI fix: initialize all engine options at start of game. Fixes
    problem with resignation setting not being obeyed.
 9) GUI fix: clear any previous game result and other details after
    loading a position file.

 1) GUI fix: takeback was not working properly.
 2) GUI fix: changing strength during a game was not working.

Changes in Arasan 17.0 (March 2013):
 1) A common hashtable is now used in both quiescence and non-
    quiescence search, instead of using a separate q-search eval
    cache (hashtable stores static evals so also serves as an
    eval cache).
 2) Scoring module no longer does lazy eval.
 3) Opening book format has changed. Manual tuned book file is
    now annotated PGN instead of a custom text format. Book code
    is simplified.
 4) Opening book is no longer modified at runtime by result and
    score learning. Only position learning (aka permanent brain)
    is supported now.
 5) Improvements to opening book and ECO classifier.
 6) Qsearch no longer does pre-selection of capture targets. 
    Qsearch forward pruning margin and logic changed.
 7) Bug Fix: correct time field of "post" output for Winboard/xboard

    option is "Tablebase type", not "TablebaseType".
 9) Bug fix: check for previous move legal before returning draw
    score.
 10) Bug fix: Don't apply history pruning to moves before the
    history phase of move generation.
 11) Bug fix to KP + wrong Bishop vs. K draw detection. 
 12) Bug fixes to lockless hashing. But also: restore validity
     check for moves fetched from hash, since lockless hashing
     is not 100% reliable. 
 13) A few evaluation changes.
 14) Improved debug output when -DSEARCH_STATS enabled.
 15) Performance fix: remove unneeded update of node count at end
     of search function.

     of games.
 17) Changes to razoring.

Changes in Arasan 16.3 (Dec. 2013):
 1) Generate/search discovered checks in qsearch.
 2) Changes to forward pruning in qsearch: re-introduce futility +
    SEE pruning in addition to filtering capture targets in movegen.
    But do not prune discovered check candidates.
 3) Prune some non-capture evasions in qsearch.
 4) Changes to check and capture extensions.
 5) Refine extension logic when null move search shows there is
    a threat related to a previous move that was reduced. 
 6) Defer SEE pruning until a legal move has been found/searched
    (fixes bugs in mate + stalemate detection).
 7) Speed enhancements in SEE, pin detection, and check status
    computation.
 8) Changes to weak pawn and outpost scoring.
 9) Cleanup code and add some extra checks in the Notation class.
 10) Fix in move generator: do not repeat hash move in winning
     capture phase. 
 11) Use shorter time check interval for very short time controls.
     Convert timing code to use high-resolution timer.
 12) Change formula for computing min book weight from selectivity
     setting, to play a wider variety of opening moves.

Changes in Arasan 16.2 (Oct. 2013):

    the connected passer bonus. Adjust various passed pawn related
    scoring params.
 2) Add engine console command for perft.
 3) Adjust scores for Rook on 7th and make dependent on game phase.
 4) Fixes to weak pawn scoring and outpost code.
 5) Simplify and fix SEE function. Use variant version with quick exit
    when only need to know if score is above or below a threshold.
 6) Improvements to move ordering for check evasions.
 7) Fix bad bug in lazy eval code of scoring module.
 8) Bug fix: don't set the retrieved hash entry type to Invalid in
    cases where the score is in bounds but moves have been pruned.

 1) Improvements to multi-core and multi-processor performance: limit
    global memory usage, do dynamic adjustment of split depth.
 2) Change book format, book weights are 0..100 not 0..10 now. New
    larger opening book is included with Arasan binaries.
 3) Book selectivity logic changed (again).
 4) Fix bug in 50-move draw detection.
 5) Move sorting no longer uses node counts; now an initial sort is
    done by move score, then subsequently PV moves are moved to the front
    each iteration, keeping other moves in the same order.
 6) Check extensions are more limited now. Overall limit on extensions
    at high ply counts from root is removed.
 7) Search time can be extended more in case of fail-low or resolving a
    fail-high.
 8) Aspiration window changes. Fix bug that can cause array overflow in
    aspiration window code.

    in release builds by default).
 10) Numerous adjustments to evaluation weights.
 11) Score pawnless KRB vs KR and KRN vs KR as draws.
 12) Bug fix: allow resignation when in fixed depth search and depth<=1.
 13) Fix bug in handling of fail_high_root flag.
 14) Convert to conditional variables for thread synchronizaton on Linux
     + Mac (fixes Mac OS problem where semaphores may not be cleaned up
     on exit).
 15) Fix stack size for threads on Mac OS (avoids bus error crash in deep
     searches).

Changes in Arasan 15.6 (May 2013):

    detection). Also though engine now reverts to using result command
    in cases of draw by rule before a move is made.
 4) Remove extra quote from response to "protover" command in Winboard
    (so myname feature works).
 5) Modify how book selectivity setting works. Selectivity has to be lower
    now to select very rare moves.
 6) A few more code portability fixes.
 7) Fix UCI protocol bugs leading to occasional loss on time with ponder on.
 8) Fix strength option scaling so play is stronger at high values.

Changes in Arasan 15.2 (Feb. 2013):
 1) Some speed improvements especially when multithreaded.
 2) Code cleanup and bug fixes related to draw handling (could lose on 
    time in server games, in rare cases, due to problems in this area).
 3) Some more code conversion to C++ style intead of C. Use STL pair template.
 4) Minimum search time changed to 10ms to better support very fast test
    games.

 12) Somewhat more general Rook pawn vs wrong color Bishop draw detection.

Changes in Arasan 15.1 (Nov. 2012):
 1) Correctly parse Winboard "level" command that includes a fractional
    part in the time increment.

 4) Changes to LMR reduction amounts and ply 0 reduction threshold. 
 5) Avoid null move if hash table info indicates it would fail to
    generate cutoff.
 6) Losing checks are no longer extended, in any case. Threat extension
    is now done differently, similar to Stockfish.
 7) Re-work of SMP code to increase thread usage by supporting the
    "helpful master" algorithm.
 8) Fix a bug in communicating with the Fritz interface, specifically
    the "process testsuite" command.

    GUI.
 2) Strength reduction operates during pondering.

Changes in Arasan 14.2 (June 2012):
 1) The chess engine handled input from the the UI in several places
    and had duplicate code for scanning input and breaking it into lines.
    This is now centralized and simplifed.
 2) Some other code cleanup, especially conversion from C-style string
    handling to C++.
 3) Simplified code for lazy eval. Partial (lazy) scores are no longer
    cached in the scoring module (such scores were seldom used anyway).
 4) Outpost scores reduced.
 5) Tweaked threshold values for history pruning and late move pruning (due
    to a bug, 14.1 actually did only late move pruning above depth = 1 ply).
 6) Reduced thresholds for static null pruning.
 7) Some changes to LMR and root move reduction logic.
 8) Bug fix: ensure final stage of ply 0 search window widening sets a
    correct upper/lower bound.
 9) Improvement to logic for searching checks in q-search.
 10) Fix material eval adjustment for Q vs 2R.
 11) Support is added for varying the engine strength via UCI or Winboard
    options (Arasan GUI supports this too).
 12) GUI bug fix: search could hang when a "Go" command is issued when it
    is the user's turn to move, and the user then makes a manual move before
    the search completes.
 13) Winboard driver fixes: pings could be processed out of order in some
    cases. Also, an extra move could be sent after Winboard has send a
    "resign" or "result" command.

Changes in Arasan 14.1 (Apr. 2012):
 1) Fix (again) UCI promotion move formatting bug.
 2) Fix Winboard "memory" command.

    short time controls.
 3) LMR is performed at root node (formerly was not).
 4) Null move uses R=3 with verification.
 5) Simplified hash table implementation.
 6) Move generator defers SEE test on captures until the move is used (this
    was done previously in the qsearch but not elsewhere). 
 7) Better sort algorithm in move generator.
 8) Fixes to learning code. Hash table (w/ learn info) was being cleared
    at each new game, now learn info is retained.
 10) Some code cleanup, esp. conversion from char * to C++ string usage.
 11) Arasan uses Gaviota tablebases. Fix tb probing when en passant
     capture possible. Tablebase hits now are cached in the hash table.

     winboard options command to send options to the engine.
 13) Fix bug involving mate scores in UCI analysis mode.
 14) Makebook program can directly consume PGN.
 15) Arasan engine source is released under the MIT license (same license used
     by the Gaviota tablebase code).

 1) Fixes to UCI analysis mode.
 2) Fix handling of UCI Threads option.
 3) Arasan GUI allows changing thread count for search.
 4) Support "cores," "memory" and "egt" features in Winboard. Note: Arasan
    command-line switches take precedence over Winboard settings.
 5) Memory for the evaluation cache is now dynamically allocated and
    is sized relative to the main hash table.
 6) Some changes to pruning and lazy eval logic.
 7) Fixed faulty bitbase data. Fixed "eval" command to handle bitbase
    and tablebase probes properly.
 8) Improve UCI time management for very short time controls.

Changes in Arasan 13.3:
 1) In Winboard mode, Arasan still accepts but does not rely on the
    deprecated "white" and "black" commands to keep track of the
    computer's side of the game.
 2) Winboard "level" command accepts time of form mm:ss and allows decimal
    times.
 3) More general code for trapped bishop.
 4) Static null pruning is implemented.
 5) Dynamic null reduction based on score (aka "smooth scaling").

 8) Hash table code cleanup & bug fixes.
 9) Intel C++ supported under Windows.
 10) GUI edit menu allows paste of PGN and FEN from the clipboard into the GUI.
 11) fix GUI memory leak.
 12) By default, Arasan will play a somewhat wider variety of openings (the
 book selectivity option can be used to change this).

Changes in Arasan 12.3:
 1) Changes to move ordering in qsearch - formerly we used to call see()
    in the initial move sorting phase but now it is deferred until we
    are ready to use a move - this is how most programs do it.
 2) Linux version uses an ASM routine (if USE_ASM is defined) for
    bit extraction - this is much faster (on CPUs that support it).
 3) Small fix to pin detection.
 4) Bug fixes in scoring: specifically in adjustMaterialScoreNoPawns,
    outpost scoring, potential passer scoring, passer piece block.
 5) Reduce penalty for open files around king (was excessive)

    adjusting piece values.
 2) More aggressive futility pruning, margin is adjusted at 1/2 ply increments.
 3) Changes to extension/pruning logic. LMR now done after futility. Extra
    LMR is done at high depths/move counts.
 4) King safety scoring changed - open files are now scored separately,
    score is based on opposing Rook + Queen count.
 5) Bishop pair score reduced (but increases in endgame).
 6) Changes to pawn scoring: outside pawn & doubled pawn scores reduced.
 7) Outside pawn calc is done via a table, like Crafty does.
 8) Penalty for own pieces ahead of passer; somewhat reduced bonus for rook
    behind passer.

 5) Increase king attack scores

Changes in Arasan 12.0 (Aug. 2010):
 1) Eval code is changed to split eval terms more explicitly into 
    opening, middlegame and endgame terms and these are merged via
    a weighting function based on material. 
 2) Some eval changes to king safety, bishop pair, etc.
 3) King safety cache was also used for opponent pawn proximity - but 
    the hashing didn't account for opponent pawns. This is fixed by
    not storing proximity in the cache.
 4) Material score adjustment added for Q vs R + Pawns, and R vs pawns. 
 5) Some new "trade down" bonus code is present to encourage exchanging
    when ahead - there was some code for this earlier but less correct.
 6) Fix to futility pruning margin calculation.
 7) Fixed a Winboard/xboard driver bug where some "ping" commands from
    ICC were being ignored.
 8) Fix a rarely occurring bug in qsearch: generating a check

    large search depths (as in endgame).
 10) Fix display in GUI game list dialog & main window to include year of game

 1) Re-work to use "magic" bitboard logic instead of rotated bitboards. About
    20-25% speedup from this.
 2) Eval re-written to use bitboard attack functions for king safety, mobility.
 3) Some changes and fixes to search (especially LMR).
 4) Check extensions are done at ply=0 now.
 5) Substantial code cleanup, more consistent variable/function naming,
    remove obsolete or redundant code. 
 6) g++ 3.2 and earlier are no longer supported.
 7) Various scoring changes, including fixes to outside passed pawn scoring.
 8) Remove unsafe optimization for q-search when in check.
 9) Remove lock on main hash table - speeds up multi-threaded searches (thanks
    to Bob Hyatt).
 10) New position learning system - keeps learn data in a text file vs a
    book file. Learn data is loaded into the main hash table (simpler and
    avoids locking). Fixes to position learn code. 
 11) Fixes for loss on time with very short time controls.

Changes in Arasan 10.4 (June 2008):
 1) Speedup illegal move detection in search.
 2) Speedups in move generation.

    thread search code and unstable searches with 1 cpu.
 2) Another search bug fix - caused problems in statemate detection.
 3) Couple of scoring fixes.
 4) Support Threads option in UCI mode.

Changes in Arasan 10.2 (Feb. 2008):
 1) Fix possible crash bug: check for previous illegal move before hash
    cutoff.
 2) Forced move extension in q-search removed - caused some searches to
    blow up (excessive nodes searched).
 3) Limited razoring removed - in its place, wider use of LMR. Consolidate
    reduction + pruning code. Disable recapture extension by default.
 4) Some pawn scoring changes. Fixed asymmetric king center score in endgame.
 5) Bug fixes in bad trade scoring. 
 6) Greater use of R=3 in null move.
 7) Linux bug fix: free semaphores on exit.

Changes in Arasan 10.1:
 1) Substantially more efficient SMP support, keeps threads more active.
 2) Some bug fixes in scoring and checking move generation, thanks to
    Keiichiro Tashiro.
 3) King safety and endgame scoring changes & fixes.
 4) Fixed bug that could cause failure to move when there is a single
    legal move from the tablebases.
 5) Fix bug that could lead to illegal moves in pv display.
 6) Fix long-existing move sorting bug.
 7) Use narrower bounds on re-search (Negascout algorithm). Reduce re-search
    frequency by setting flag when score is exact.
 8) Fix bad search bug involving illegal move detection - in some cases a
    valid score was returned after a previous illegal move. One symptom
    was problems with stalemate detection.

Changes in Arasan 10.0:
 1) Fix to pawn scoring: a doubled pawn behind a passed pawn is no longer
    counted as passed also.
 2) Changes to king safety and mobility scoring. Bishop and queen attacks
    and mobility are now checked in all directions (was formerly only the
    "forward" direction).
 3) Other scoring changes, including adjustments to piece trade scoring.
 4) Multi-core/multi-procesor (SMP) support is now working, using the YBWC
    algorithm. However the "helpful master" concept is not yet implemented.
 5) Now supports 6-man tablebases. Some fixes added to better tolerate
    incomplete 6-man tb sets.
 6) Checks in q-search are on by default now. Checking moves are generated
    for 1st two plies of q-search (configurable), but can be extended in
    some cases.
 7) Forced move extension tweaked - move generator marks move as forced
    when a singular check evasion that is not a winning capture exists.
 8) Some changes also to late move reduction and recapture extension code.
 9) Null move verification search was broken - it works now.
 10) Another fix for draw scoring - avoid draw when opponent is lower rated

    can be enabled in the q-search (off by default).
 3) Scoring changes: king safety, passed pawn, piece placement, bad trade.
 4) Engine will kibitz if on ICC and opponent is a computer.
 5) Fix for PV display under Arena with UCI: use O-O, O-O-O for castling.
 6) Fix result learning information in arasan.log.
 7) Fix draw accept logic - was erroneously accepting draws from lower
    ranked players on ICC in some situations.
 8) Fix tablebase probe logic - probes in more cases now.
 9) The usual book additions/fixes.

Changes in Arasan 9.3:
 1) Another KBP vs K draw fix.
 2) Bug fixed in pawn race scoring.

    been changed, so that Arasan will play a somewhat wider
    selection of openings.
10) UCI protocol support.
11) GUI fixes to work on 120DPI displays. Also some fixes put in for
    GUI occasionally getting out of sync with engine.

 1) Bug fixes in pin detection
 2) Scoring changes
 3) Better lazy eval in scoring module.
 4) Improved pawn race scoring, handles more cases.

 3) Pawn scoring changes.
 4) Killer move phase now uses killers at ply-2.
 5) GUI fix: "Think When Idle" option didn't work properly.

Changes in Arasan 8.0 (Aug. 2004):
 1) Extended futility pruning is implemented now. Futility pruning and
    razoring can be combined.
 2) Passed pawns are scored higher.
 3) "Capture" extension is now disabled by default.
 4) Fixed some bugs in king-pawn hash table code
 5) Minor changes to hash probe code. 
 6) Default tablebases cache size increased, changes to tablebase probe
    logic. Generally this version does fewer probes.
 7) New egtb code from Eugene Nalimov & Andrew Kadatch.
 8) Significant changes to evaluation. Evaluation is simpler and 
    faster. A small evaluation cache is used.
 9) Various speed enhancements, in move generator and elsewhere.
 10) Some fixes to 50-move draw handling.
 11) "makebook" program can now filter moves so that only moves
     occurring with a minimum frequency will be included. New book
     uses minimum frequency of 6 from a large PGN game collection.
 12) a few minor GUI fixes.

Changes in Arasan 7.4:
 1) King safety and knight centrality scoring fixes (knight centrality
    was actually backwards - White table was used for Black).
 2) Speed improvement: routine wouldCheck handles more cases, allowing
    more cases of forward pruning before doMove.
 3) Fix GUI bug re "hint" being given for the wrong side.
 4) Fix GUI bug: next/previous game could crash if engine reply comes
    after the command.
 5) Fix GUI bug: takeback while engine is searching could sometimes

    loading a new game from a file.
 2) Fixed GUI bug re "think when idle" setting not being passed to
    engine.
 3) Incomplete games were not saved with an incomplete ("*") result - 
    this is fixed.

 5) Some minor search improvements.
 6) Some opening book fixes.

Changes in Arasan 7.0:

 1) Fixed a bug in handling of the "en passant target" square when
    loading a FEN position file.
 2) Numerous speed improvements in the engine. Move generation is
    incremental now.
 3) Razoring has been modified.
 4) Fixes and ehancements have been made to tablebase use in the
    endgame. Tablebase hits are now cached, for faster speed.
 5) Several endgame scoring fixes and improvements have been made.
 6) Mate scores in the winboard driver are normalized to 100.
 7) GUI can set board colors now, like Arasan 5.4.
 8) GUI repaint has been optimized for faster speed.
 9) Misc. other GUI fixes.

Changes in Arasan 6.3:

 1) More changes to king safety
 2) Fixes to tablebase support, to work better with 5-man tablebases.
 3) Some move ordering improvements and speedups.
 4) GUI now ignores engine moves received when in "force" mode -
    fixes problems with takeback command while the engine is
    searching.
 5) Sometimes Arasan could hang on ICC when it receives a move
    without a carriage return. There was code to fix this, but
    it had to be updated now that Winboard can use SAN for moves.
 6) Windows installer now uses InstallShield Express version 4.

Changes in Arasan 6.2:

 1) More fixes to time management.
 2) Several positional scoring changes have been made. King safety
    is somewhat different in this version. Lazy evaluation in the
    scoring module has been made more efficient.
 3) Some recoding has been done in the quiescence search for
    faster speed. A somewhat different forward pruning technique
    is used in the q-search.
 4) This verison does "adaptive null pruning" similar to that
    described by Ernst Heinz.
 5) The "bad trade" scoring is now tapered off as material drops -
    this fixes some bad behavior at the threshold of bad trade scoring.
 6) There were problems with the GUI only partially initializing
    before trying to read a file specified on the command line.
    This is fixed. 
 7) Some fixes were made in Winboard analysis mode. In particular,
    Arasan would go into a tight loop when it hit a mate score.
    Now it stops analyzing and waits for a command.
 8) Some GUI and engine fixes were made to fix bugs with switching
    sides using "Computer Plays White" menu item.

Changes in Arasan 6.1:

 1) Some speed improvements were made in several areas.
 2) Some opening book additions and corrections were made.
 3) The GUI showed the letter coordinates backwards when
    the board was turned - this is fixed.
 4) GUI display of mate scores was incorrect - this is fixed.
 5) In the GUI, loading a new PGN file after one has already 
    been loaded left the engine in an incorrect state - this
    is fixed.
 6) Game results could be shown backwards (e.g. a White win
    instead of Black) in some circumstances. This is fixed.
 7) Some king safety scoring improvements and fixes were made.
 8) Arasan 6.0 could lose on time, especially in short
    time control games with pondering enabled. Some fixes
    have been made to make this less likely to happen.

Changes in Arasan 6.0.1:

Patch to fix problem with initializing tablebases (Windows only).

Changes in Arasan 6.0:

 1) A Linux version is now available. 
 2) The king safety routine has been rewritten for greater
speed and accuracy.
 3) The search routine has been recoded. Futility
pruning as described by Ernst Heinz is implemented. Razoring
is now done in the main search routine and not in a separate
one as in 5.4. Extensions have been changed.
 4) More elaborate lazy evaluation is done in the scoring
module and more aggressive forward pruning in the quiescence
search.
 5) Passed pawn scores have been increased, as have bonuses
for king centrality in the endgame (plus king near pawns,
if the pawns are on one side of the board).
 6) Lots of fixes in the Winboard/xboard driver (arasanx.cpp),
for greater reliability and to get it to work under Linux using
xboard. One bug fix is that pondering took place
without the global move list being updated: this broke
3-time repetition detection and could result in the program
playing into a draw when it shouldn't.
 7) A bad bug was fixed in the opening book code - an integer
overflow in the frequency field of a book entry. This caused
problems, but only in multi-megabyte sized books. Note: the
book format has changed for this version. Older binary book
files will not work with version 6.0. 
 8) A rare but annoying bug was fixed - sometimes the castling
status was set incorrectly after a rook move. 
 9) In version 5.4, after loading a position from a file (e.g.
from the xboard -lpf command), the opening book could fail to
work because the castling status was incorrect. A fix for this
has been made in bhash.cpp.
10) A smaller hand-tuned book is provided with this version.
11) Book learning based on game results is implemented. Some fixes
and enhancements were also made to positional learning.
12) An "arasan.rc" file can be used to tweak many program
parameters.
13) Winboard/xboard analyze mode is supported.
14) This version has been tested with Winboard 4.2.6. The "new"
Winboard protocol is supported.
15) Arasan can use compressed Nalimov tablebases. 
Eugene Nalimov and Andrew Kadatch retain copyright to the
portions of the code that implement tablebase handling and
decompression. It is included in the Arasan source 
distribution with permission.
16) The Windows version has a new simplified GUI that runs
the chess engine as a separate process, like Winboard.
TrueType fonts are now used instead of bitmaps for the
pieces.
