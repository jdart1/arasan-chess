<h1>Arasan Programmer's Guide - version 25.1</h1>
<p>by Jon Dart</p>
<br/>
<p>Arasan is a chess program.</p>

<p>Usage of the source code is governed by the MIT license: see the
  <a href="https://www.github.com/jdart1/arasan-chess/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">LICENSE
file</a> for details.</p>

<p>Arasan includes a console-based chess engine that be used with
Winboard, a separately available interface for chess programs, or with
UCI-compatible interface programs such as Arena and Shredder. In
addition, a custom Windows-only user interface program for Arasan is
available; it communicates with the chess engine using a pipe.</p>

<p>Arasan is written in C++. Versions before 6.0 ran only on Windows. In
version 6.0 and higher, the Arasan chess engine supports both Windows
(32- or 64-bit versions) and other platforms such as Linux, but the
Arasan GUI is still Windows-only.</p>

<p>Arasan has mostly been tested on Intel & AMD processors, but the code
is designed to be portable to other processors (there is some assembly
code in bitboard.h, but that is not used unless you compile with
-DUSE_ASM).</p>

<p>The remainder of this file contains information for use by programmers
reading or working on Arasan source code. I assume that you have a
working familiarity with C++. Also, if you have no background in
computer chess, you should probably start by reading some of the
reference material mentioned at the end of this document.</p>

<h2>Building Arasan</h2>

<p>See the BUILD.md file in the github doc directory for current build
instructions.</p>

<h2>Opening book</h2>

Arasan stores the opening book in a binary file (book.bin). </p>

<p>Since book.bin is supplied with the Arasan program distribution, you
do not need to build this file in order to build Arasan. However, if
you want to modify the contents of the opening book, you will need to
edit the ASCII source for the openings and rebuild book.bin, and for
this you will need to build the "makebook" program that is part of the
source distribution. Following is further information on creating a
book file. </p>

<p>The book for Arasan is converted from text files to the binary book
by the console program makebook.exe.</p>

<p>The input files used to generate the opening book are in Portable
Game Notation (PGN) format. More than one PGN file can be specified
as input.
</p>

<p>When multiple files are used, makebook treats the first one specially.
The first file is a "steering" book used for manual tuning of the opening book weights.
This file can be annotated using standard PGN comments and Numeric
Annotation Glyphs (NAGs). A file with such annotations is supplied
with the Arasan source and is named "basic.pgn".</p>

<p>In the annotated PGN file, an explict weight can be specified by 
putting a comment with the string "weight: " followed by a numeric value
after a move. Weights are between 0 and 100. A weight of 0
means that the computer will never play the move, but will respond to
it if it is played by its opponent. The higher the weight, the more
often the computer will choose the move. By default, if no weight is specified,
moves are selected at runtime based on win/loss/draw statistics and the
move frequency.</p>

<p>PGN files can also have numeric annotation glyphs (best to use
an editing program such as ChessBase to insert these). If present these
have the following meaning in the context of "makebook:"</p>
<pre>
!! - a very good move, give it the maximum possible weight.
! - a good move, weight it 50% higher than normal.
!? - a worthwhile move, weight it 25% higher than normal
? - a dubious move, do not play it
?? - a blunder, do not play it.
</pre>
<br/>
<p>Glyphs can also be used to assign an evaluation to the end of an
opening line and if so this evaluation modifies the weighting of
moves along that line.</p>
<p>Formerly relative book weights were stored in the book file. Now generally they are not: except for special first PGN file, move records
only store the win/loss/draw statistics for the move. Book move weights can effectively vary at runtime, within a range.</p>
<p>Book move selection can be controlled by a "Book variety" option that can be set via UCI or CECP options, or by a line starting with
  "search.book_variety" in the arasan.rc file. The variety option can vary from 0 to 100. Low values will cause the program to
  tend to play main lines, and more strongly prefer moves that have good statistics or high manual weights in the book files.
  Higher variety values will allow a wider range of moves to be displayed, including those that have poor statistics or low
  manually set weights. Note that high variety settings (>50) may negatively affect program strength, as inferior moves will be
  played more often.</a>
Book move selection logic (see bookread.cpp) is as follows (based partly
on Thompson sampling - see references):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Drop, based on a tunable parameter, very infrequent moves out of the book move set. Also drop moves that were set manually to "don't play" (zero weight).</li>
    <li>Perform the Thompson sampling step: take a random sample from the prior distribution of win/loss/draw statistics for each move. The sample gives a win/loss/draw combination that is similar to, but may randomly differ from the actual win/loss/draw statistics.</li>
    <li>Taking into account contempt, compute a result score (wins + contempt factor*draws/total games) for all book moves.</li>
    <li>Adjust the bonus score based on any manual weight or annotations in the "steering" book.</li>
    <li>A further bonus is given based on the log of the move frequency (in an amount depending on the book variety option).</li>
    <li>Add a further normally distributed random factor to the score, in an amount based on the book variety option (higher variety values will product more randomness).</li>
    <li>Pick the move with the highest score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Arasan comes with a book that was built from a combination of a fairly
small hand-tuned book file (basic.pgn) and a fairly large collection
of high-quality human and computer games. There are over 800,000 moves
in the book.</p>
<p>You can make your own book file using the makebook utility.
Typical usage would be like this:</p>
<pre>
makebook -n 100 -m 4 -o book.bin basic.pgn big.pgn
</pre>
<br/>

<p>The -n parameter to makebook specifies how many "index pages"
are in the binary book file. You may have to experiment with this
parameter. Too small a value will cause an error building the
book. Too large a value will waste space by creating a bigger book.bin
than is required.</p>
<p>You can also specific the "-m" parameter to makebook with a number,
to set a minimum number of times that a move must be played in a
game collection to be included in the book (does not apply to the first
PGN file). The default book shipped
with Arasan was built with "-m 4". Other options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>-p &lt;number&gt; - sets maximum ply depth for moves extracted from a PGN file</li>
<li>-o &lt;filename&gt; - sets output file name (default book.bin)</li>
<li>-v - show more verbose output.</li>
</ul>
<p>See bookdefs.h for some documentation about the data layout within
the book.bin file.</p>


<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>Arasan has positional learning (a.k.a "permanent brain"). This feature
is off by default, but can be enabled via CECP or UCI options. It is
basically a persisent hashtable. If a search returns an unexpectedly
high or low score, the position and its score are stored in a text file.
The text file name and location are configurable, but by default:</p>
<ul>  
  <li>on Windows it is called arasan.lrn and is in the user's APPDATA directory,
    Arasan subdirectory</li>
  <li>on Linux/MacOS, it is called .arasan.lrn, and is located in the user's
    home directory</li>
 </ul>
When the next game is started, stored positions
from this file are read into memory and stored in the hash table,
enabling the program to detect danger or opportunity sooner
than it did previously.</p>


<h2>ECO Recognizer</h2>

<p>Arasan can produce an ECO (Encylopedia of Chess Openings) code for a
given game. As with the opening book, the mapping of chess positions to
ECO codes is contained in a text file. The file is called "eco" and is
in the "misc" directory. It contains a series of lines, each starting
with an ECO code, followed by a series of chess moves, and ending with a
quoted string that contains the English name of the opening.</p>

<p>The "makeeco" program reads the "eco" data file and outputs to stdout
a C++ file that is then compiled into Arasan. The generated file is
called "ecodata.cpp" and contains a single large C data structure.</p>

<p>Because Visual C++ makefiles don't handle generated source files like
this one, you need to run "makeeco" manually whenever you change the
"eco" data file.</p>

<p>makeeco takes a single argument: the location of the eco file. It
writes the generated ecodata.cpp file to stdout.</p>

<p>Note: the ECO recognizer is pretty crude right now, because Arasan
does not contain all the possible ECO lines and sublines in its data file.
Therefore transpositions that wind up in an ECO subline like
C18/3 but skip the position that is stored for C18 may not be
recognized correctly. Transpositions across opening systems may also
be missed.
There is no general solution for this problem,
since the ECO classification scheme is ambiguous in some cases, but
recognition could be improved by expanding the number of positions in
the eco file. If the number becomes large enough, however, the
current method of building a data structure and compiling it into
Arasan might have to be changed.</p>

<h2>Parameter tuning</h2>

<p>If compiled with TUNE=1 passed to the Makefile, or with -DTUNE in the
compiler flags, Arasan enables parameter tuning by an external program,
by presenting the internal tunable parameters as UCI options. Currently
only integer-valued parameters are supported. One program that can use
such options for tuning is <a href="https://github.com/jdart1/Lakas">Lakas</a>.
</p>

<h2>Testing support</h2>

<p>Arasan includes several features to aid debugging. The code contains
  asserts that will be triggerd if compiled in debug mode (-g for gcc/clang,
  /Zi for Windows). If you also compile the
  source with -D_DEBUG, some additional runtime checks are performed and
  will trigger asserts if they fail.</p>

<p>At runtime, adding the "-t" (trace) flag to the arasanx executable will
  cause it to output trace messages detailing its operations, including
  commands received from and sent to the interface. Trace
messages are formatted approprately depending on
the protocol (UCI or winboard). For Winboard, these messages
will show up in the debug log if Winboard is started with the
"-debugMode true" flag. For UCI engines, the debug output will appear as
"info" output and will for example be recorded by cutechess-cli if the
-debug option is specified.</p>

<p>The chess engine supports a couple of non-standard commands to aid with testing.
The "eval" command will evaluate the current position and output its static evaluation.</P>
The "test" command followed by the name of a test suite file in EPD
format, do a search on each position in the file, and output the
results to stdout.  Additional switches can be added after the
filename:</p>
<ul>
<li>-v - prints more verbose output</li>
<li>-d &lt;depth&gt; search to fixed depth (plies)</li>
<li>-t &lt;seconds&gt; searches for the specified number of seconds per position</li>
<li>-N &lt;variations&gt; show multiple variations (default 1).</li>
<li>-x &lt;count&gt; can terminate the search early if the correct move is found and held for "count" plies.</li>
<li>-o &lt;file&gt; stores test output in "file".</li>
</ul>
<p>Either -d or -t must be included as one of the options.</p>
<p>If the search module is compiled with -DSEARCH_TRACE, arasanx will print
out copious information about the search process when it is run (if
running multi-threaded, only the main thread is traced). See
search.cpp to see what information is output and where it comes from. If compiled
with NNUE_TRACE, the engine will enable detailed tracing of the NNUE evaluation. Note:
output from these traces can be very large if a deep search is performed.</p>

<h3>Test Suites</h3>

<p>The following test suites are provided with the source code (see the
"tests" directory):</p>
<ol>
<li>wacnew.epd contains the 300 problems from Reinfeld's "Win At Chess"
book. These are mostly easy tactical problems (a few are hard). This
test suite is widely used by computer chess programmers. "wacnew" is
a revised version with a number of corrections and additions to
Reinfeld's oroginal solutions.</li>
<li>ecmgcp.epd contains a subset of test positions from the Encyclopedia
of Chess Middlegames, selected and corrected by Gian-Carlo Pascutto.</li>
<li>
bt2630.epd is a set of 30 chess problems, with a range of
difficulty.  This is used to determine an approximate rating for the
program. Standard procedure is to allow 15 minutes for each
problem. Add the time needed to find the correct answer (900 for
problems that are not solved), divide by 30, and subtract from
2630. Note: some corrections from Dann Corbit have been applied
to this file.</li>
<li>
lapuce2.epd is a set of 35 tests from the French chess magazine
La Puce Echiquenne. This is another test that purports to estimate
a program's rating. Standard procedure is to allow 10 minutes for
each problem. See lapuce2.doc for the scoring procedure.</li>
<li>
arasan2024.epd is a set of test positions from Arasan games, plus some
from other sources. They range in difficulty, but most are non-trivial
and some are quite hard. This is the latest version of the test
suite. Some positions in this file are "avoid move" positions where
there is a bad but superficially tempting move.</li>
<li>
iq4.epd is a set of positions from the book "Test Your Chess IQ".
Jim Monaghan selected and corrected some tests from this book.
I have made some further modifications to the test and this version,
which I use, is in the file "iq4.epd". These tests are run at 10
seconds per position.</li>
<li>
pet.epd is a set of endgame tests from Peter MacKenzie, the author
of the freeware chess program "Lampchop". I have applied a few
corrections to Peter's original test suite.</li>
<li>
eet.epd is a set of endgame tests from Walter Eigenmann. See
<a href="http://www.beepworld.de/members38/eigenmann/e_e_t.htm">http://www.beepworld.de/members38/eigenmann/e_e_t.htm</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The results file in the tests subdirectory summarizes Arasan's
performance on these test suites. There is a Perl script (tests.pl)
in the tests directory that generates a summary of test results
given a log file produced by the Arasan "test" command.</p>

<h3>Perft</h3>

<p>A built-in command in the engine can be used to run the <a href="http://chessprogramming.org/Perft">"perft"<a/> command
for testing. The command "perft"
should be followed by a number indicating the ply depth for the
computation.</p>

<h3>Unit tests</h3>

<p>The Makefiles provide a "unit" target, which builds a unit test
  program (unit on Linux/Mac, unit.exe on Windows). This program will
  execute a series of tests, including ones which verify
a set of critical functions operate correctly, verify that evaluation
results are symmetrical between White and Black sides, and also run
and verify the perft test over a set of positions.</p>

<h2>Algorithms and data structures</h2>

<h3>The chess board</h3>

<p>Following is some information about the algorithms and data structures
used by Arasan. If you are new to computer chess programming, I suggest
first reading a general work on the subject such as Frey (1983) or
Marsland and Schaeffer (1990).</p>

<p>The chess board in Arasan is represented by an array of 64 squares,
laid out so that square a1 has the value 0 and square h8 has the
value 63 (Note: versions before 11.0 had a different layout with a8=0).</p>

<p>Each square contains 0 if it is empty, or a piece identifier if it is
occupied.  Black pieces have identifier values between 1 and 6, while
White pieces have values between 9 and 15.  A special value (127) is
used to represent a square that is uninitialized or invalid.</p>

<p>The Board class also maintains several "bit boards" or quantities that
that hold 64 bits. The Bitboard class in the source encapsulates a
bit board. For example, the occupied bit board has one bit set
for every piece that is on the board (there are actually two such
bit boards, one for Black and one for White).</p>

<p>Each type of piece has its own bit board that has one bit set for
each piece of that type (for example, there is a rook_bits
Bitboard to hold rook locations). Since there is only one king
location, though, this is kept in an integer variable.</p>

<p>Besides the bit boards, there is some other information in the Board
structure. The enPassantSq variable holds the square position at which an
en passant capture is possible (if none is possible, it has the value
IllegalSquare). The castleStatus array holds an enum for each side
indicating whether castling has occurred. Also, if the king or a rook
has been moved, making castling on one side or another impossible,
castleStatus is set to an appropriate value.</p>

<p>Each board position also has a hash code associated with it. The
hash code is 64 bits and is computed by fetching, for each piece and
square combination, a unique 64-bit code from a table of random
numbers, and computing the exclusive or of these codes. (This hashing
mechanism for chess was invented by Zobrist - see references). The
low-order bit of the hash code is then set to identify whether White
or Black is to move. Castling status and en passant status are also
folded into the hash code, because positions with the same piece
layout but different castling rights or possible en-passant captures
must be kept distinct.</p>

<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>
Arasan uses a 64-bit word to store move information. Each move
contains a start square, destination square, promotion value, the type
of piece being moved, the type of piece being captured (if any), and the
type of move (normal, castling, en passant, etc).</p>

<h3>Attack Generation</h3>

<p>Earlier versions of Arasan used rotated bitboards for computation of
attack information. The rotated bitboards allow computing which pieces
attack a square without using any loops in the code, just shift and
mask operations. Starting with version 11.0, a different approach is
used: it produces much the same benefits but is faster. This approach
uses a technique called "magic bitboards", which basically computes a
hash code that looks up attack information, in a way that ensures there
are no invalid hash collisions.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this, but the algorithms and data
structures used in Arasan follow an approach initially published by
Pradyumna Kannan.  The constants for the 64-bit version were
constructed by generation code posted by Tord Romstad. The 32-bit
version follows an approach first taken by H. G. Mueller, as discussed
in the Winboard Forum. Starting in version 20.3, Arasan alternatively
supports computing sliding attacks using the x86_64 PEXT AND PDEP
instructions, as first suggested by Michael Sherwin and later by
Zech Wegner (see references).</p>

<p>The magic bitboard code is primarily in file attacks.cpp. There are
two versions of the code: one uses 64-bit multiplication (or
PEXT/PDEP if enabled) and is designed for a 64-bit
architecture. The other uses only 32-bit multiplications. One or the
other is automatically selected at compile time based on the target
processor architecture.</p>

<h3>Move Generator</h3>

<p>The move generation logic is mostly contained in the
MoveGenerator class and uses the magic bitboard attack functions.</p>

<p>The MoveGenerator class has separate routines to find all moves
and to find just capture moves - the latter is all that is required
in the quiescence search. Move generation is done incrementally,
because if a move is found that causes cutoff, there is then no
need to generate the rest of the moves for that position. Specifically,
Arasan uses the "Fancy Magic Bitboards" technique described in the
Chess Programming Wiki (see References), which was invented by
Pradu Kannan.</p>

<p>Move generation occurs in this order (this is for positions where
the side to move is not in check, and in the regular search, not
the quiescence search):</p>
<ol>
<li>
The principal variation move if one is available (see description
of Search module).</li>

<li>Capture moves and pawn promotions are generated, and sorted. In
this phase only apparently winning captures and promotions are included.
The move generator initially sorts captures by MVV/LVA (most valuable
victim/least valuable aggressor). Then, when moves are being actually
selected for search, a static exchange evaluation is done on those
moves with non-positive MVV/LVA score. Moves that have a negative SEE
score are deferred to the losing capture phase. This approach minimizes
calls to SEE, which is expensive.</li>

<li>"Killer moves" are returned if available. A killer move is a
non-capture, non-promoting move that is valid in the current board
context and previously caused beta cutoff at the current ply. Killer moves are indexed by piece type and dest square.</li>

<li>At this point all non-capturing moves are generated. 
The previous move is used to probe the "refutation table". This
is a simple replace-always table that holds moves that have refuted
another move (by causing the search to fail high). 
Refutations are indexed by the previous move that
was made by the opponent.
If the move
list includes a move found in the refutation table,
then that move is returned first before any of the history
moves and is flagged as belonging to the refutation phase.</li>

<li>All other non-capturing moves are returned, in sorted order. The
ordering is based on a score derived from the move history and
countermove history.</li>

<li>Losing captures are searched.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, the move generation process includes moves that are illegal
because they place the side to move into check - these are weeded
out in the search routine.</p>

<p>If the side to move is in check, a special function (generateEvasions)
is called that strictly checks moves for legality. It is very important
to know whether any legal moves are possible when in check: if there
are none, the side to move is checkmated. Also, some search extensions
depend on the existence of a forced move (one single legal move). Currently
evasions are generated in two phases: first the hash move is tried, if
there is one, and then only if that fails to produce cutoff is the full
set of evasion moves generated.</p>

<p>Move ordering at the root node is done somewhat differently. The first
time moves are generated at ply 0, a rough sorting by score is
done. The next few plies are searched with a wide window, partly to
facilitate "easy move" detection (a move that appears to be much better
than alternatives may be selected after a shorter than usual search,
so for example the program does not waste time on an obvious recapture).
But another side-effect of the wide window is that we obtain scores for
all moves and Arasan will sort the moves for the next iteration based
on these scores.</p>
<p>After the "wide window" part of the search is over, the next iteration
is searched putting the best move from the last iteration first. If 
another move then becomes best, it replaces the previous best move
and all other moves are shifted down, so that 
their ordering from the previous iteration is retained in
the next iteration.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>Arasan uses an alpha-beta search algorithm with a variety of search
extensions. The search class is the largest single module in the
program, and is necessarily rather complicated, but I have tried to
structure it and comment it so that it is understandable. I will
assume that the reader knows the basics of the alpha-beta algorithm,
and will concentrate on describing this implementation of it.</p>

<p>In general, the search routine tries to terminate a search tree, or
some portion of one, as soon as possible, and will defer as much work
as possible until it is certain that no earlier and quicker
termination can be done. The techniques for doing this are mostly
well-known and there is nothing very original about the search
algorithms used by Arasan. However, as with most chess programs,
there is a fine balance between terminating a search too soon and
extending it into unprofitable and very unlikely lines of play. The
precise nature of this balance depends not only on the search
algorithms used, but also the relative efficiency of operations such
as move generation, position evaluation and move ordering. Each
program therefore strikes this balance in a somewhat different way.</p>

<p>The entry point for a search is a routine called findBestMove. This
function does some initialization, and then calls ply0_search, which
implements the alpha-beta search algorithm. The search proceeds one
ply (half move, i.e. move by one side) at a time. That is, first a
one-ply search is done, then a two-ply search, then three, etc. until
either the maximum ply limit has been reached or the time control has
been exceeded. Each search uses the results of the preceeding search. 
The variable "iterationDepth" holds the current nominal ply depth for
the search. However, the presence of search extensions means that
some nodes may be searched to a greater depth than this.</p>

<p>In the first few iterations of the ply0 search, Arasan now uses wider
than usual search bounds, so that each move gets a preliminary score.
The scores are used to order the moves for deeper searching, and for
"easy move" detection: if one move is found to have a significantly
higher score than all others, and if subsequent searching still
selects this move, then the search may be terminated early.</p>

<p>ply0_search does some other special processing and bookkeeping because
it is at the top of the search tree. This function then calls search()
to recursively process lower-depth nodes.</p>

<p>The first step in search() is to check if the current board position
is drawn, due to insufficient material, a 3-fold repetition of
moves, or the 50-move rule.</p>

<p>If the position is drawn, move_search calls the function drawScore.
Usually a draw is given a score of 0, but when playing on a chess server,
the relative rating of the opponent is also factored in, so that
draws against a lower-rated opponent are penalized.</p>

<p>Arasan will also terminate the search immediately if the absolute
maximum ply depth is reached. This is quite unlikely.</p>

<p>If no draw is present and the maximum depth hasn't been reached, the
next step is to look in the hash table (further described in the next
section), in order to see if an identical position has been visited
before. This may happen due to a transposition of moves that lead to
the same position, or because a previous search to a shallower depth
visited the same node. If a hash table entry is found and if it
contains a valid value (i.e. one that did not cause cutoff), then that
value is returned immediately and no further searching from that node
occurs. In other cases, the hash table may not contain an exact value,
but may hold an upper or lower bound that can be used to narrow the
alpha-beta window.</p>

<p>If the hash table lookup didn't produce an exact value or narrow the
bounds enough to cause cutoff, then we may also try the endgame 
tablebases, if they are installed and enabled, and if material is
reduced enough that they can give an exact score.</p>

<p>In non-PV nodes where the side to move is not in check,
Arasan first tries a couple of techniques to
decide if the entire node can be pruned away, before doing any
searching.
The first of these is "static null pruning", which cuts off search for
nodes that have very high scores.</p>

<p>If still no cutoff has occured, we then try a further trick to get a
fast termination of the search. The side to move is changed without
altering the board position and the opposing side is then allowed to
move. Of course, this could not occur in a game - a player is not
allowed to "pass," but must move. However, the theory is that if the
null move causes cutoff, then the side to move must have a good
position, since in effect giving the opponent a free move still
produces a high value for the side to move. In this case, beta cutoff
is allowed to occur and no more searching is done from this node.</p>

<p>Starting in Arasan 2.0, null move pruning is applied in subtrees that
are themselves part of a null move search, provided that two null
moves are not tried in a row. This is known as the "deep null"
algorithm. See Donninger's article in ICCA for more information on
this algorithm.</p>

<p>A null move is searched to a depth less than that used for regular
moves.
Arasan uses at least a so-called R=3 depth reduction for the null move search:
in other words, a search is done with the regular 1-ply reduction in
depth plus three extra plies. (At high depths, a depth-dependent amount is added to the reduction factor.)</p>

<p>After a null move produces a beta cutoff, Arasan does an extra
reduced-depth verification search to ensure that the null move cutoff is
actually valid. The verification search uses reduced depth, but doesn't
insert the null move first.</p>

<p>After null move search, but before the regular search, Arasan
now applies a pruning mechanism called ProbCut (see Buro).</p>

<p>If neither the null move search nor ProbCut cause cutoff, then we must actually do some searching from the current node.</p>

<p>The first move searched is called the "principal variation" move. In
the case of an initial search (e.g. a one-ply search), the principal
variation move is just the first move returned by the move generator.
Otherwise, at ply 0, it is the highest-scoring move from the previous
search iteration. At deeper plies, the hash table is queried and if a
best move has been stored for the position, that move is tried first
and is considered the principal variation.</p>

<p>In cases where there is no hash move, we do a shallow search to obtain a
suitable move to try first. This is called "internal iterative
deepening" and has been used in Hitech (see Ebeling's book) and also Bob
Hyatt's program Crafty.</p>

<p>Now (in most cases) we should have an initial move to try (if not we
generate all moves and take the first one). We make the move, then
query the attack info for the board to see if the side to move is in
check (remember, the move generator typically does not exclude moves
into check). If a move into check is found, the special value Illegal
is returned and the next move is tried. If the move passes the legality
check, then move_search is called again (i.e., it is recursive).</p>

<p>Normally each move searched reduces the "depth" variable by a constant
(DEPTH_INCREMENT). When depth reaches zero, the quiescence search
will be entered (see below).</p>

<p>However, some moves are searched to a greater depth than normal. There
are several cases in which this occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
If the move checks the opponent, the search is extended, provided
that the checking move does not lose material (according to SEE) or is a
discovered check.</li>
<li>
Pushing a pawn to the 7th rank causes the search to be extended,
on the theory that this pawn may soon promote.</li>
</li>
<li>If a safe capture is done and the last opponent
piece has been captured, the search is extended.</li>
<li>Arasan now implements <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Singular_Extensions" target="_blank">singular extensions</a>. If a hash move exists and is a lower bound, and if a shallow-depth search shows that all moves except the hash move have low scores, then the hash move is considered "singular." Singular moves are searched with greater depth.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that since Arasan 5.0, most extensions can be a fraction of a full
ply. Search "depth" is normally decremented by the constant
DEPTH_INCREMENT every time a new ply is begun; however, extensions can
decrement it faster, typically an additional amount between 1/2 of a
full ply and a full ply.</p>
<p>
Individual extensions can be combined, but at any given ply, the total
depth reduction from extensions cannot exceed DEPTH_INCREMENT, the
equivalent of one extra ply.</p>
<p>
The principal variation phase of the search is over when we have found
a legal move and searched its descendants (including quiesence nodes)
so that we have a value for it. It is possible that this value will
be greater than beta, which means that we have set the initial search
window wrong and must repeat the search with a different window.</p>
<p>
Assuming the principal variation move does not cause cutoff or mate,
then the search function proceeds to search the remainder of the
moves. These moves are searched with a zero-width alpha-beta window
(i.e. beta is set to alpha+1). All such searches will cause a
cutoff. If the value returned by the search is between alpha and the
original beta, then the search is repeated with a wider search window
to determine the correct score. It is generally faster to get a fast
cutoff and then re-search with a wider (but not infinite) window than
to do a single search with unlimited bounds.</p>
<p>
Note that since the principal variation move is usually obtained from
the hash table or the root move array, it may be the case that the
move generator has never had to be called during the principal
variation search. If so, we call it before doing the non-p.v. moves.</p>
<p>
Arasan now optimizes things further by only generating part of the
moves at a time. That way, if cutoff occurs, the remainder of the
move generation can be skipped.</p>
<p>
Arasan also performs several types of pruning and depth reduction.
These are the opposite of extensions: instead of searching deeper,
Arasan either cuts off the search prematurely (pruning) or reduces
the search depth.</p>
<p>
Arasan uses "late move reductions." After the first few moves have
been searched, including any killer moves, if the move is not
extended, and if it is not considered potentially dangerous or
advantageous, then the search depth is reduced. This can occur even at
high depths in the search tree. If the reduced depth move returns a
score above alpha, it is re-searched with normal depth. This technique
became popular due to its use in Fabien Letouzey's program "Fruit".
</p>
<p>
Arasan also does several different kinds of pruning.  Several tests
are made on each move and if the move was extended for any reason, or
if it is a capture, special move (like castling) or advance of a
passed pawn, then it is not pruned.</p>
<p>
Note that it is necessary to search at least one legal move before any
pruning is done, because we need to distinguish nodes at which no
moves are searched due to stalemate from those at which all nodes
would cause pruning. Also no pruning is done at the root node.</p>
<p>
Futility pruning in Arasan is similar to that described by Ernst Heinz
for the program Dark Thought. It allows some moves to not be searched,
if it determined that the side to move is behind in material and the
move to be made is not likely to gain enough material to be worth
considering. But moves with good history scores are not pruned.</p>
<p>
Futility pruning is applied at relatively low search
depths before the quiescence search and during the quiescence search.
First the program computes an optimistic score for the 
move and adds a margin that varies based on search depth; the sum is
then compared against alpha and the move is pruned if the optimistic
score + margin is still below alpha.</p>
<p>
Late move reduction is done before futility pruning and the futility
margin is based on the reduced depth (if a reduction was done).</p>
<p>
Arasan also does "late move pruning." In non-PV nodes, quiet moves
that are in the history phase of move generation (after the pv move,
winning captures, and killer moves) and are relatively late in the
move order can be pruned away. The theory is that if we have not
already achieved a cutoff searching more moves is not likely to
produce one.</p>
<p>Another pruning method recently implemented is based on
countermove and follow-up history scores. Quiet moves with bad history
scores are pruned at low depths.</p>
<p>
In addition at depths just before the quiescence search, moves that
appear to lose material based on a static exchange analysis are
pruned. This is done with more liberal pruning conditions than other
types of pruning.</p>
<p>
The final part of search() checks to see if checkmate or stalemate
occurred, updates the hash table, and maintains the best variation.
It also updates history scores, but only if the best move is not a
promotion or capture. The best move from the search gets a history
bonus. The remaining moves are given a penalty. Scores are
maintained in a table (per thread) that is indexed by side, source square
and destination square.  In addition, Arasan now maintains a countermove
history table and a "follow up" history" a.k.a. continuation history
table (ideas from Stockfish). All history tables are used in move
ordering and history values are a factor in computing the amount of
late move reduction.
</p>
<p>
When the search terminates at ply 0, it updates the "Statistics"
structure with the time and other information about the search
(key parts of this structure are also updated during the search
when the p.v. changes, so the UI and test suite code can monitor it).</p>

<h3>Quiescence search</h3>

<p>As noted above, each recursive call to move_search decrements the
"depth" parameter by a constant (DEPTH_INCREMENT). When "depth" drops
below zero, Arasan enters the quiescence search by calling function
quiesce(). Like search(), this is also a recursive search routine.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the goal of the quiescence search is to reach a
relatively "quiet" position that can be more or less accurately
evaluated. Generally, "quiesce" will only generate and search capture
moves that appear to gain material, promotions of pawns, and moves
that escape from a check.</p>

<p>If in check, all evasion moves are generated although some
"quiet" evasions may be pruned and not searched.</p>

<p>The quiescence search for positions not in check also does forward
pruning on moves, dropping any that appear to lose material based
on the static exchange evaluator and those that fail a futility
test.</p>

<p>Generally, forward pruning costs time (especially if the static
exchange evaluator, "see", needs to be called), and involves some risk
of dropping valuable capture moves. But, on the plus side, it
significantly trims the size of the search tree.</p>

<p>The quiescence search terminates when no more moves of an appropriate
type are available. The search may also terminate early if the side to
move is not in check, and the current evaluation of the position is
enough to cause cutoff. The theory here is that the side to move can
choose to not capture any further. If the current evaluation is good
enough to cause cutoff, there is no need to try captures and
promotions to get a better score.</p>

<p>In version 10.0 and later, for nodes where it is not in check, if no
cutoff has occurred so far, the quiescence search will generate and
search moves that give check, at least in the first couple of
quiescence search plies. But checks that appear to lose material are
pruned.</p>

<h3>The hash table</h3>

<p>The search routine uses a hash table for storing the results of
evaluating previously visited positions. This table is implemented in
several static functions defined in hash.cpp. The hash table is
basically an array of lists. Each list contains a series of nodes, each
of which contains some data (in the case of the search engine, a class
of type Position_Info) and a pointer to the next node. Each list holds
entries that hash, modulo the hash table size, to the same value. Each
node contains the whole hash code, so that finding a given node to match
a given hash code consists of indexing into the hash table, then
following the list until the full 64-bit hash codes match.</p>

<p>Besides the hash code, each hash entry also contains the score for
the node, a set of flags indicating whether the value is exact, an
upper bound or a lower bound, the depth of search used to evaluate
the node, a word holding the castling status and en passant square,
and the best move for the position.</p>

<p>The hash table is limited in size and may fill up during a long
search. In this case, we have a choice: when a new position is
encountered, we can overwite an existing entry in the hashtable with
the new position, or we can discard the information for the new
position and not put it into the hashtable.</p>

<p>Arasan will generally only replace entries that have greater depth
than existing entries, or entries that came from an earlier search
(i.e. whose "age" field does not match the current search).</p>

<p>The hash table is not
cleared after each search: instead, it is kept full, but old entries
(from the previous search) are considered candidates for replacement.</p>

<p>The size of the main hashtable defaults to 64 Megabytes. Standard Winboard or
UCI option commands can also be used to alter the hash table size at
runtime. UCI or Winboard settings can
be overridden with the -H switch on the arasanx command line, followed by a size (such as '256M').
(The arasan.rc also can set the hash table size, but this
is not recommended).
</p>

<p>Because multiple threads can be reading and writing the hash table,
a "lockless hashing" technique is used to prevent conflicts (as done
in Crafty). When a hash key is stored it is xored with the data value.
When retrieving, the current data contents for a hash table entry are
xored again with the stored hash key and this is used to match the
hash key for the position. If another thread has overwritten or is
overwriting the data field, then the comparison will fail and a match
will not be returned.</p>

<p>Besides the main hash table, some smaller hash tables are used by
the Scoring module to store the results of pawn structure scoring and
king cover calculation. These are relatively small in size and are
allocated on a per-thread basis (each thread has its own tables).</p>

<h3>Position Scoring</h3>

<p>Arasan now uses exclusively an NNUE evaluation function, in place of its
older hand-coded evaluation. The only remaining non-NNUE component consists
of bitbases used for KPK scoring.</p>

<h2>Neural Network (NNUE)</h2>
<p>Arasan 23.0 introduced support for a <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE" target="_blank">
Efficiently Updatable Neural Network (NNUE)</a>
that performs evaluation of chess positions. NNUE evaluation for chess was first introduced in Stockfish, whose implementation
of it was contributed to the Stockfish project by Hisayori Noda aka Nodchip.</p>

<p>Arasan's implementation of NNUE
was originally in a submodule, the source of which is at <a href="https://github.com/jdart1/nnue"
                                                        target="_blank">https://github.com/jdart1/nnue</a>.
But starting with commit 2ef5d79, the NNUE source has been incorporated into the Arasan source tree.</p>

Arasan's first  NNUE implementation was
compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/cb9c2594fcedc881ae8f8bfbfdf130cf89840e4c", target="_blank">SFNNv4</a>
  network architecture used in Stockfish 15. Version 25.0 introduces a new simpler architecture,
consisting of a horizionally mirrored feature transformer with 9 King buckets, followed by a hidden layer with 8 buckets based on material level.</p>
<p>Tuning was performed using the <a href="https://github.com/jdart1/bullet", target="_blank">Bullet tuner</a> using a combination of  positions from Arasan selfplay games (generated from the "selfplay" utility program) and Lc0 training data.
<p>The output from bullet must be post-processed to be readable by Arasan (currently, a version
number is prepended to the file, which is checked at runtime). There is a utility program,
"post_process_nn," in the source that can perform this. It takes two arguments: the first is the
output file from bullet (quantised.bin), and the second is the desired output filename.</p>
<p>The actual network data is loaded at runtime from a file. Unlike Stockfish and some other programs,
Arasan does not embed the network data in the program executable. The default file name is compiled into the executable.</p>

<h2>Multi-threading</h2>

<p>Arasan version 9 and above have support for using more than one
thread during searching, enabling it to make use of multi-processor machines and
multi-core CPUs. Version 10.0 was the first version to have this fully
implemented.</p>

<p>A pre-requisite for implementing multi-threading is that global
data structures that are accessed for read & write be made safe
for parallel access, usually using locking.</p>

<p>However, locking has a performance overhead and is generally
infeasible to do on a per-node basis. Arasan now does not lock the
main hash table, to avoid this penalty, but uses a lockless hashing
mechanism as described earlier.</p>

<p>My first attempt at implementing multi-threading used the ABDADA
algorithm (see Weill's article). This is simple to implement since it
uses the hash table as a single point of synchronization and control,
but it did not perform well, because this usage of the hash table
interferes with its normal usage as storage for scores and best moves
from previously visited nodes. Consequently, the hash hit rate
was reduced and multi processors did not achieve much of a speedup.</p>

<p>Arasan then implemented what is called the Young
Brothers Wait concept (YBWC). This algorithm was described in Feldmann's
Ph.D. thesis (see References) and several related publications in the
early 1990s.</p>

<p>Arasan's current implementation uses what is called LazySMP. This
has been implemented in several strong engines including Stockfish. It is
somewhat similar to ABDADA conceptually. It entails letting each thread
search from the root position using a standard alpha-beta aspiration
search. No synchronization across the threads is done. Practically the only
shared data structure is the global hash table. Threads in each
iteration are started at somewhat different search depths, which
helps avoid having them visit exactly the same nodes. The first thread
is treated somewhat differently from the others: only it is allowed to
output search progress updates, and its fail high/fail low history is
used when making time control decisions. Each thread maintains its own
Statistics structure, which holds interim search results. When a search
termination condition (such as time up) is reached, all threads will be
set back to idle and returned to the wait loop in the thread pool. The
individual search results from each thread are then examined. The
best result from all threads is the one that is returned as the overall
search result, with the caveat that the result chosen must also have a
final search depth not less than other threads.</p>

<h2>Windows user interface</h2>

<p>The Windows user interface was re-written for version 6.0, although
some code from earlier versions is still in use. The main difference
from earlier versions is that the chess engine is now run as a
separate process that communicates with the user interface through a
socket, exactly like Winboard does. This is done to eliminate some
problems that occured when using threads to manage the engine/UI
communication in earlier versions.</p>

<p>Compared to Winboard, the Arasan UI lacks some features: for example,
it cannot be used to communicate with a chess server, and has no
facility for editing positions.</p>

<p>The Arasan user interface is a pretty standard MFC program. It uses
the single document interface (SDI) model, so there is only one
document class instance and one view instance active.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of the Arasan UI used bitmaps for display. The new
version uses TrueType fonts. Several chess fonts are included in the
program distribution. The original font archives, which include
copyright and usage information, can be found in the fonts subdirectory
of the Arasan source distribution.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>While no formal support is offered
for this software, if you do find bugs in
it, or discover a way to improve it, I would like to hear from you.</p>
